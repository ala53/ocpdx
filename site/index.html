	The Optimist Club of NE Portland was formed in 1952 
	after becoming a chapter of Optimist International. 
	Our Club has been active in the Portland area. 
	By being “a friend of youth”, the Optimist Club 
	of NE Portland feels that the programs we run or 
	support financially should help our youth cultivate 
	a positive attitude,  promote leadership skills, 
	foster independence, inspire creativity, encourage 
	patriotism, and nurture self-esteem.
	<br/>
	<br/>
	The current programs we run are in the Portland Metro 
	area are the <a href="http://optimist.org/e/member/scholarships3.cfm">Optimist International Essay</a> and 
	<a href="http://optimist.org/e/member/scholarships4.cfm">Oratorical Contests</a>, 
	Optimist Kids Day at Oaks Park, Face Paint U, 
	Christmas Dinner Deliveries, and Ronald McDonald House 
	Cookie and Pizza baking.  
	<br/>
	<br/>
	Programs we support financially 
	are Remembering Americas Heroes, six teams through Portland 
	Parks Basketball League, Fit Kids Garden/Walk, and 
	Candlelighters of Portland.
	
	If you have a program that meets our criteria, <a href="contact.html">let us know</a> 
	and we will consider it!</h5>
