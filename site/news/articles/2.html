<h5 class="section-content">We just had our yearly barbecue with Candlelighters yesterday. As a fundraiser for the Candlelighters charity, 
which helps children who have cancer, hundreds came and enjoyed a lunch provided by our chapter of the Optimist Club and rides at Oaks Park.
Pictures are available <a href="barbecue.html">here</a>.
