	<br>
	The Essay Contest is sponsored by Optimist International to give young people 
	the opportunity to write about their own opinions regarding the world in which 
	they live. The approach can encompass a young personâ€™s personal experience, 
	the experience of their country or a more historical perspective. In additional 
	to developing skills for written expression, participants also have the 
	opportunity to win a college scholarship!
